/* The World Bank's international debt data
This is a project that I am working on from DataCamp. A country can go into debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one of the expensive ingredients necessary for citizens to live a comfortable life. https://www.worldbank.org. The World Bank is an organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, we will analyze international debt data collected by the World Bank. This dataset contains information on the amount of debt (in USD) held by developing countries across several categories. We will find answers to several questions:

1. World Bank international debt data
2. Find the number of different countries
3. Find different debt indicators
4. Summing up the amount of debt held by these countries
5. Countries with the highest debt
6. Average amount of debt across all indicators
7. Highest amount of principal repayments
8. Most common debt indicator
9. Other viable debt issues and conclusions
