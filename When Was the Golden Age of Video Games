/* When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?
In this project, I will analyze video game critic and user scores and sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I will search for the golden age of video games by identifying the release years that users and critics liked the most, and I will explore the business side of games by looking at game sales data.

The search will involve combining data sets and comparing the results with set theory. You'll also filter, categorize and sort the data.

Project tasks:

1. The ten best-selling video games
2. Missing review scores
3. Years that video game critics loved
4. Was 1982 really that great?
5. Years that dropped off the critics' favorites list
6. Years video game players loved
7. Years that both players and critics loved
8. Sales in the best video game years
